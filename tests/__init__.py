"""
Test Suite for Gravitational Wave Hunter.

This package contains comprehensive tests for the gravitational wave detection
framework, including unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks.

Test Coverage
------------
- Data generation functions (GW signals, colored noise)
- Model architectures (CWT-LSTM autoencoder, simple autoencoder)
- Training and evaluation functions
- CWT preprocessing pipeline
- Model performance and accuracy

Test Categories
--------------
- test_data_generation: Tests for signal and noise generation
- test_model_architecture: Tests for neural network models
- test_training: Tests for training functions
- test_evaluation: Tests for evaluation and metrics
- test_cwt_preprocessing: Tests for CWT preprocessing pipeline

Notes
-----
All tests are designed to ensure the reliability and correctness of the
gravitational wave detection framework.
